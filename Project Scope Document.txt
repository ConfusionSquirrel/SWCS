My final project, the Savage Worlds Combat Simulator, is primarily a tool for anyone involed in the
tabletop roleplaying game Savage Worlds (similar to D&D). It will pit two teams of robots, designed
according to the guidelines laid out in the SW Sci-Fi companion, against each other until only
one remains. Combat will be designed to closely but not fully mimic the combat system of Savage
Worlds. The project will give the user the ability to customize the teams, with multiple models of
robots to choose from.
