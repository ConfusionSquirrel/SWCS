The following tests should determine whether the program is functioning properly:

-Ensure the simulation resets properly by pressing the cancel button at every stage of the simulation:
	-Should bring you back to the main menu
	-Should revert the simulation back to the map choosing screen if "start simulation" is pressed again

-Ensure there are no removal issues by placing and then removing one of each kind of robot on each team:
	-Removal buttons should only allow removal of bots from their team
	-Should appropriately update team lists

-Ensure there are no movement/combat/damage errors by placing one of each type of robot on each team and playing through:
	-Log should reflect what is seen on the map
	-Incapacitated robots should not be targetted or attacked
	-The simulation should end when one team is empty; the next turn button should then be inactive
	-Robots should have no more than one turn per round

-Ensure the simulation can't start with any empty list by trying to run it with no robots, only a robot from team 1, and only a robot from team 2
	-Should resist advancing to the next phase
	-Should output a notice that teams cannot be empty

-Ensure map limitation is in effect by attempting to run a "coming soon" map
	-Button should be inactive






*KNOWN BUG*
-If you cancel rather than choosing a type for a robot, the map will show its icon there even though the robot doesn't exist
	-This can be fixed by placing a robot of either team on that location and then removing it; the tile will revert to blank
